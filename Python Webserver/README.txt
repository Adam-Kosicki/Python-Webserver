IDE Used:
PyCharm CE

How to run:
1. Open PyCharm and import Webserver.py
2. Run Webserver (green arrow)
3. “Listening on port 8080 …” should be shown in console
4. Open Google Chrome and type into address bar, “http://localhost:8080/…” where … is the file name

For example:
If I have a file named test.html in the same directory (folder) as Webserver.py, I would type “http://localhost:8080/test.html” into the address bar in Chrome.
